# Leaderboards Guide

Leaderboards show rankings for segment times. This guide explains how leaderboards work, filtering options, and how to climb the ranks.

## Understanding Leaderboards

Every segment has a leaderboard showing all recorded efforts ranked by time. Each entry shows:

- **Rank**: Position on the leaderboard
- **Athlete**: Name with link to profile
- **Time**: Elapsed time for the segment
- **Date**: When the effort was recorded
- **Activity**: Link to the full activity

## Leaderboard Types

### Overall Leaderboard

Shows all athletes ranked by fastest time. The top spots are:
- **KOM** (King of the Mountain): #1 male
- **QOM** (Queen of the Mountain): #1 female

### Filtered Leaderboards

Filter by demographic to see rankings among similar athletes:

#### By Gender
- Men's leaderboard
- Women's leaderboard

#### By Age Group
- 18-29
- 30-39
- 40-49
- 50-59
- 60+

Combine filters to see, for example, the women's 40-49 age group leaderboard.
